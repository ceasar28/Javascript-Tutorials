/**
 * Goal: Create an Enumeration
Let's create an enumeration like CARD_SUITS above. Our enumeration will be named ORDER_TYPES and describe the different types of orders that are possible in our system.

The first type should be PIZZA, with a value of 0.

After that, create at least 2 more options of your choice!

 Get creative! Some ideas for other choices: WINGS, SALAD, BURGER, FRIES, SANDWICH.

const ORDER_TYPES = {
  PIZZA: 0,
  WINGS: 4,
  SALAD: 5,
};
